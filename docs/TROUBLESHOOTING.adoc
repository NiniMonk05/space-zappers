| Game lags every few seconds in Microsoft Edge on Linux
| Edge may be using software compositing instead of GPU acceleration. Go to `edge://flags`, search for "GPU rasterization", and set it to *Enabled*. Restart Edge.

| Leaderboard shows "No scores yet" when accessing via IP address (172.16.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
| Some browsers (especially Edge) block WebSocket connections to external servers when the page is served from IP addresses. Access via `localhost:8088` instead.

| Nostr extension not found when accessing via IP address
| NIP-07 browser extensions like Nos2x only inject `window.nostr` on whitelisted origins. IP addresses are typically not whitelisted. Access via `localhost:8088` instead.

| Can't use Nostr extension on mobile
| Mobile Chrome doesn't support extensions. Use *Edge* (Android), *Kiwi Browser* (Android), or *Firefox* (Android) which support Chrome/Firefox extensions. On iOS, extension support is limited to Safari Web Extensions.
